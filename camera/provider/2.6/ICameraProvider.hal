     * Get a vector of combinations of camera device ids that are able to
     * configure streams concurrently. Each camera device advertised in a
     * combination MUST at the very least support the following streams while
     * streaming concurrently with the other camera ids in the combination.
     *
     *       Target 1                  Target 2
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     * | Type         |   Size   |   Type       |   Size   |
     * -----------------------------------------------------

     * | JPEG         |  s1440p  |                         |
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     * | PRIV         |  s1440p  |                         |
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     * | YUV / PRIV   |  s720p   |  YUV / PRIV   | s1440p  |
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     * | YUV / PRIV   |  s720p   |  JPEG         | s1440p  |
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     *
     * where:
     * s720p - min (max output resolution for the given format, 1280 X 720)
     * s1440p - min (max output resolution for the given format, 1920 X 1440)
     *
     * If a device has MONOCHROME capability (device's capabilities include
     * ANDROID_REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_MONOCHROME) and therefore supports Y8
     * outputs, stream combinations mentioned above, where YUV is substituted by
     * Y8 must be also supported.
     *
     * The camera framework must call this method whenever it gets a
     * cameraDeviceStatusChange callback adding a new camera device or removing
     * a camera device known to it. This is so that the camera framework can get new combinations
     * of camera ids that can stream concurrently, that might have potentially appeared.
     *
     * For each combination (and their subsets) of camera device ids returned by
     * getConcurrentStreamingCameraIds(): If only the mandatory combinations can
     * be supported concurrently by each device, then the resource costs must
     * sum up to > 100 for the concurrent set, to ensure arbitration between
     * camera applications work as expected. Only if resources are sufficient
     * to run a set of cameras at full capability (maximally
     * resource-consuming framerate and stream size settings available in the
     * configuration settings exposed through camera metadata), should the sum
     * of resource costs for the combination be <= 100.
     *
     * The lists of camera id combinations returned by this method may contain
     * hidden physical camera ids. If a combination does contain hidden physical
     * camera ids, the camera framework must be able to open any logical cameras
     * that contain these hidden physical camera ids in their
     * ANDROID_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA_PHYSICAL_IDS list, in addition to the other
     * camera ids advertised in the combination, for concurrent operation.
     *
     * @return status Status code for the operation
     * @return cameraIds a list of camera id combinations that support
     *         concurrent stream configurations with the minimum guarantees
     *         specified.

     * The per device streamList must contain at least one output-capable stream, and may
     * not contain more than one input-capable stream.
     * In contrast to regular stream configuration the framework does not create
     * or initialize any actual streams. This means that Hal must not use or

     *
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * Preconditions:
     *
     * The framework can call this method at any time before, during and
     * after active session configuration per device. This means that calls must not
     * impact the performance of pending camera requests in any way. In
     * particular there must not be any glitches or delays during normal
     * camera streaming.
     *
     * The framework must not call this method with any combination of camera
     * ids that is not a subset of the camera ids advertised by getConcurrentStreamingCameraIds of
     * the same provider.
     *
     * Performance requirements:
     * This call is expected to be significantly faster than stream
     * configuration. In general HW and SW camera settings must not be
     * changed and there must not be a user-visible impact on camera performance.
     *
     * @param configs a vector of camera ids and their corresponding stream
     *                configurations that need to be queried for support.

     *     OK:
     *          On successful stream combination query.
     *     METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED:
